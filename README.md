Arduino World

This website is meant to give beginners a way to learn the fundamentals of Arduino, from what it is to what it can do. 

One section is devoted to teaching the basics of electricity, hardware, software, and Arduino itself. The next
provides multiple projects at different skill levels for users to implement. The final section provides
links to outside resources to help deepen understanding of Arduino or branch out into different microcontrollers.
